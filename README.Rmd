## `jsdmnc` package 

**Goals of this package :**

- run JSDM model on tree inventories in New Caledonia
- run PCA or tSNE to decrease dimensions
- determine number of tree's communities
- clustering pixel in communities
- determine most common tree in each community

All of this with nice plots to understand each step.
